## Acknowledgements

These examples have been adapted from Chapter 7 of

The Simulink model used in Lab Exercise 18 was developed by Third Year EEE Student Fahad Alqahtani as part of his Level 3 Project in 2013-2014.

## Preparation

Before we start today's lab you will need to download and install the [Fourier series demo app](http://users.ece.gatech.edu/mcclella/matlabGUIs/#FourierSeries) that was demonstrated in class.

To install, visit the page and right-click the link where it says **Download** and save as to your week7/lab6 folder. Double click the downloaded zip files to unpack.

Open and run `fseriesdemo/fseriesdemo.m`.

If Matlab issues a message about the need to change the working directory or add a folder to the Matlab path. Accept the choice given.
