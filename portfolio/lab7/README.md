The Simulink model used in Lab Exercise 18 was developed by Third Year EEE Student Fahad Alqahtani as part of his Level 3 Project in 2013-2014.

## Preparation

Before we start today's lab you will need to download and install the [Fourier series demo app](http://users.ece.gatech.edu/mcclella/matlabGUIs/#FourierSeries) that was demonstrated in class.

To install, visit the page and right-click the link where it says **Download** and save as to your week7/lab6 folder. Double click the downloaded zip files to unpack.

Open and run `fseriesdemo/fseriesdemo.m`.

If Matlab issues a message about the need to change the working directory or add a folder to the Matlab path. Accept the choice given.

## Lab Exercise 17: Computation of the coefficients of Trig. Fourier Series

In this lab exercise we will review the Fourier series for a square wave with odd and even symmetry before going on to compute and plot the Fourier series for the *triangular* waveform.

We will also explore and confirm the stated results of even-, odd- and half-wave symmetries.

### Before you Start

Download attached files:

* [FourierSeries.m](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/blob/master/portfolio/lab7/FourierSeries.m)
* [trig_fseries.m](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/blob/master/portfolio/lab7/trig_fseries.m)

and store them in your `lab7` folder.

### Part 1

Examine and run the script `trig_fseries.m` (which calls the `TrigFourierSeries` function defined in `TrigFourierSeries.m)` to calculate the trigonometric Fourier series for the square wave with odd-symmetry.

### Part 2

Copy the script `trig_fseries.m` and save it as `ex17_1.m`. Change the copy so that it computes and plots the trig. Fourier series for the square-wave waveform with even symmetry (Section 7.4.1 in the textbook).

### Part 3

Copy the script `trig_fseries.m` and save it as `ex17_2.m`. Change the copy so that it computes and plots the trig. Fourier series for the Triangular waveform (Section 7.4.3 in the textbook).

## Exercise 18: Simulating Wave Anaysis

Downoad and open the Simulink model [fourier_example.slx](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/blob/master/portfolio/lab7/fourier_example.slx?raw=true). Examine the settings for the sine terms and compare the amplitudes and frequencies of the settings with the results of running `trig_fseries.m`. Run the simulation and view the reconstructed signal and the spectrum.

### Part 4

Change the settings so that the simulink model uses the coefficients from the square-wave even-symmetry result. Simulate and capture the time and spectrum plots. Save your model as `ex18_1.slx`.

## Part 5

Change the settings so so that the simulink model uses the coeffiecents from the triangular wave result. Simulate and capture the time and spectrum plots. Save your model as `ex18_2.slx`.
