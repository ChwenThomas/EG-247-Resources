## Scope and Background Reading

This session is an introduction to sampling theory. It reviews the important
ideas that pertain to sampling but leaves the detailed mathematics for your
further study.

The material in this presentation and notes is based on Chapter 15 of [Benoit
Boulet, Fundamentals of Signals and
Systems](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/swansea/docDetail.action?docID=10228195)
from the **Recommended Reading List** and you'll find the mathematical
treatments there. There is much more detail in Chapter 9 of [Steven T. Karris,
Signals and Systems: with Matlab Computation and Simulink Modelling, 5th
Edition](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/swansea/docDetail.action?docID=10547416)
from the **Required Reading List**.

## Agenda

* Sampling of Continuous-Time Signals
* Signal Reconstruction
* Discrete-time Processing of Continuous-Time Signals
* Sampling of Discrete-Time Systems

## Acknowledgements

We will be using an adaptation of a pair of demo scripts to illustrate
*alialising*. These scripts were published by Prof. Charles A. Bouman, School of
Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University as part of the course
materials for [ECE438: Digital Signal
Processing](https://engineering.purdue.edu/VISE/ee438/demos/).

## Introduction

* The *sampling process* provides the bridge between continuous-time (CT) and
discrete-time (DT) signals
* Sampling records discrete values of a CT signal at periodic instants of time.
* Sampled data can be used in *real-time* or *off-line* processing
* Sampling opens up possibility of processing CT signals through *finite impulse
response* (FIR) and *infinite impulse response* IIR filters.

# A Real Example

## Sound sampling

I need a volunteer to provide a sound sample ....

1. I will use this script [sampling_demo.m](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/tree/master/week9/matlab/sampling_demo.m) to
sample your voice.
2. I will then playback the recording.
3. I will the plot the data.

## Technical Details

* **Sampling rate**: 8000 samples per second (fs = 8 kHz)
* **Resolution**: 8 bits per sample
* **Channels**: 1 channel.
* **Reconstruction**: Matlab plays the audio back at 8192 samples per second.


## Question

What will the bit-rate be for playback?

## Answer

bit rate = [number of samples per second] x [number of bits per sample] x
[number of channels]

bit rate = $8192 \times 8 \times 1$ bits/second [baud]

bit rate = $65,536$ bits/second

# Sampling CT Signals

## Sampling CT Signals

What is going on here?

## Time domain

Sampling can be modelled as the multiplication of a continuous-time signal by a
sequence of periodic impulses as illustrated here. $T_s$ is the period of the periodic sampling function.

![Sampling](pictures/sampling.png)

This is a form of **modulation**


## Frequency domain

Multiplication in time domain is *convolution* in the frequency domain

![Frequency domain](pictures/sampling_fr.png)

$\omega_s$ is the frequency of the periodic sampling function = $2\pi/T_s$.

## The Mathematics

**The Sampled signal**:

$${x_s}(t) = \sum\limits_{n =  - \infty }^{ + \infty } {x(n{T_s})\delta (t -
n{T_s})} $$

**Frequency convolution**:
$${X_s}(\omega ) = \frac{1}{{{T_s}}}\int_{ - \infty }^{ + \infty } {X(\upsilon
)} \sum\limits_{n =  - \infty }^{ + \infty } {\delta (t - \upsilon  - k{\omega
_s})} \,d\upsilon $$

## The Mathematics (continued)

**Sampling property**:

$${X_s}(\omega ) = \frac{1}{{{T_s}}}\int_{ - \infty }^{ + \infty }
{\sum\limits_{n =  - \infty }^{ + \infty } {X(\omega  - k{\omega _s})} } \delta
(t - \upsilon  - k{\omega _s})\,d\upsilon $$

**Sifting property**:

$${X_s}(\omega ) = \frac{1}{{{T_s}}}\sum\limits_{n =  - \infty }^{ + \infty }
{X(\omega  - k{\omega _s})}$$

## Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem

Gives a sufficient condition to recover a continuous time signal from its
samples $x(nT_s)$, $n$ is an integer.

**Sampling Theoreom**

Let $x(t)$ be a band-limited signal with $X(\omega) = 0$ for
$|\omega|>\omega_M$.

Then $x(t)$ is uniquely determined by its samples $x(nT_s)$, $\infty <n <
+\infty$ if

$$\omega_s > 2\omega_M,$$

where $\omega_s = 2\pi/T_s$ is the sampling frequency.

## Notes

The sampled signal $x_0(t)$ carries the same information as the samples
themselves, so we should be able to recover the entire signal $x(t)$.

From the block diagram of the sample-and-hold operator, what we would need to do
is find the inverse of the ZOH system with impulse response $h_0(t)$ and then
use a perfect lowpass filter.

The frequency response $H_0(\omega)$ is given by the usual sinc function for an
even rectangular pulse signal, multiplied by $e^{-j\omega T_s/2}$ because we
need a time delay of $T_s/2$ to make the signal causal:

$${H_0}(\omega ) = {T_s}{e^{ - j\omega {T_s}/2}}\frac{{\sin \left( {\pi
\frac{{{T_s}}}{{2\pi }}\omega } \right)}}{{\pi \frac{{{T_s}}}{{2\pi }}\omega }}
= 2{e^{ - j\omega {T_s}/2}}\frac{{\sin \left( {\omega {T_s}/2} \right)}}{\omega
}$$

The inverse of $H_0(\omega)$ is given by

$${H_1}(\omega ) = {H^{ - 1}}(\omega ) = \frac{1}{2}{e^{j\omega
\frac{{{T_s}}}{2}}}\frac{\omega }{{\sin \left( {\frac{{{T_s}}}{2}\omega }
\right)}}$$

The *reconstruction filter* is the cascade of the inverse filter and the lowpass
filter:

$$H_r(\omega)=T_sH_{\mathrm{lp}}(\omega)H_1(\omega)$$

The frequency response of this filter and additional notes are to be found on
Page 546 of Boulet.

# Signal Reconstruction

## Signal Reconstruction

**Problem**

* We have a bandlimited signal that is sampled at the Nyquist-Shannon sampling
frequency $\omega_s = 2\pi/T_s$.
* We therefore have a discrete-time (DT) signal $x(nT_s)$ from which we want to
reconstruct the original signal.

## Perfect Signal Interpolation Using sinc Functions

* In the *frequency domain*, the ideal way to reconstruct the signal would be to
construct a chain of impulse $x_s(t)$ and then to filter this signal with an
ideal lowpass filter.

* In the *time domain*, this is equivalent to interpolating the samples using
time-shifted sinc functions with zeros at $nT_s$ for $\omega_c = \omega_s$.

This image was generated by the Matlab script:
[sampling.m](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/tree/master/week9/matlab/sampling.m)

Each impulse in $x_s(t)$ triggers the impulse reponse of the lowpass filter (the
sinc signal), the the resulting signal $x(t)$ at the output of the filter is the
sum of all thse time-shifted sinc signals with amplitudes equal to the samples
$x(nT_s)$.

$$x(t) = \sum\limits_{k =  - \infty }^{ + \infty } {x(n{T_s}){\rm{sinc}}} \left(
{\frac{{t - n{T_s}}}{{{T_s}}}} \right)$$

(Note we have defined ${\rm{sinc}}(x)$ as $\sin(\pi x)/(\pi x)$.)

This is clearly unfeasible, at least in real-time, so we have to resort to
approximations of the ideal low-pass filter.

A couple of examples are given below. Boulet gives more information including an
evaluation of the quality of the approximation.

In practice, the zero-order-hold is often used in practice and a low-pass filter
with a flat passband (such as the Butterworth filter discussed in the last
lecture) would be used. In audio applications, for example, the low-pass nature
of speakers and the human ear add additional smoothing and for non HiFi
applications (e.g. an MP3 player) may be all that is actually used!

# Aliasing


## Aliasing

* Aliasing Occurs when the sampling frequency is too low to ovoid overlapping
between the spectra.

* When aliasing oucus, we have violated the sampling theorem that is $\omega_s <
2\omega_m$.

* When aliasing occurs, the original signal cannot be recovered by lowpass
filtering.

### An Aliased Signal

<img src="files/pictures/aliasing.png">

### Example 1

We use the recording made at the start and run it through a script that
effectively aliases the original signal be reducing the sampling frequency to
less than half the original sampling frequency.

Here's the script: [aliaseg1.m](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/tree/master/week9/matlab/aliaseg1.m) that I'll be using.

### Example 2

Assume signal $x(t)=\cos(\omega_0 t)$ is sampled at a rate of $\omega_s =
1.5\omega_s$, violating the sampling theorem.

We can see the effect on the plot below:

<img src="files/pictures/aliasing_ex.png">

Image generated by [aliasing.m](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/tree/master/week9/matlab/aliasing.m)

You should confirm for yourself that after lowpass filtering the spectrum with a
filter with cutofff frequency $\omega_c = \omega_s/2$ that the signal returned
is the spectrum of $x(t)=\cos(\omega_0 t/2)$

### Antialising Filters

* Most real signals are not band-limited so we have to artificially make them
bandlimited  using an *anti-aliasing filter*.

* An antialiasing filter is a low-pass filter whose cutoff frequency is lower
than half the sampling frequency.

* This can produce some distortion at high-frequencies but this is often better
than the distortion that would occus at low frequencies if aliasing was allowed
to happen.

* For more on this topic see Pages 551&mdash;552 of Boulet.

### Example 3

This example uses anti-aliasing to downsample the audio. You should hear that
the sound is less distorted as we sample below the sampling frequency of 8 kHz.

Script: [aliaseg2.m](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/tree/master/week9/matlab/aliaseg2.m)

### Practical application - digital audio

Human beings can hear sounds with frequencies up to around 20 kHz so when
recording music in the modern sound studio (or phone or PC for that matter) the
audio signal is antialiased with a 22 kHz filter. The signal is then sampled at
44.1 kHz before being stored for later processing and/or playback.

## DT Processing of CT Signals

<img src="files/pictures/ct-to-dt.png">

The concepts presented in this session provide a model that allows us to cross
the bridge between the theoretical concept of impulse chain sampling through to
a representation of a signal as discrete sequence $x[n]$ (to be introduced next
lecture) and back to a continuous-time signal via reconstruction.

The mathematics predicts the nature of the signals that are processed in the
ideal case, but we will leave it with you to study these for yourself. (See
Boulet pp 552&mdash;557).

In practice, modern digital processing relies on the use of an analogue-to-
digital converter (ADC) (which also introduces amplitude quantization), finite-
length arithmetic inside the discrete-time system (usually a microprocessor,
microcontroller or digital signal processor), followed by conversion back to a
step-wise continuous signal via a digital to analogue converter (DAC) that
operates like a zero-order-hold.



## Sampling of DT Signals

* In modern signal processing and digital communications many of the operations
that were once done in continuous time are now done entirely in discrete time.

* For example, we can implement sampling and modulation in discrete time.

* We can also upsample (interpolate between samples) or downsample (reduce the
number of samples in a discrete-time signal)

These topics are left to you for further study.

## Matlab Functions used

* The matlab recorder command is: `recorder =
audiorecorder(Fs,nBits,nChannels);`
* Sound is recorded using: `recordblocking(recObj, time);`
* Recorded sound is played back: `play(recorder);`
* Sound is extracted as Matlab data using: `x = getaudiodata(recorder);`
* Sound is plotted against sample number using: `plot(x)`
* I extracted 50 points for the stem plot using
`stem([1000:1049],myRecording(1000:1049))`
* Sound is saved as an audio file using: `audiowrite(audioFile,myRecording,Fs);`
where `audiofile` is a filename in form `name.extension`. Supported extensions
are `'.wav'`, `'.ogg'`, and `'.flac'` on all platforms. Windows and Mac support
`'.m4m'` and '`.mp4`'.
* Sound is loaded using `[x,Fs]=audioread(audioFile);`. Additional file formats
are supported for reading including `'.mp3'`.
* Frequency response spectra were generated using the fast Fourier transform
(`fft`) function.
* Multiple graphs in one figure window is achieved using `subplot`.

For more information use `doc` *command* from the command-line.

Try increasing the sampling frequency: 8000 Hz, 11025 Hz, 22050 Hz, 44100 Hz,
48000 Hz, and 96000 Hz are supported by most PC sound cards.

Try increasing the bits per sample: 8, 16, 24 are available.
